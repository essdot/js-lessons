# JS-Lessons

I've written some Javascripts in my day. This is my attempt at explaining some parts of how the language works. The intent is to focus on parts of JS which typically do not get in-depth explanations, or which I find to be explained poorly.

This is not intended for beginners to Javascript, or beginners to programming. This is intended for people who use Javascript often. Maybe you've used Javascript for years, or less than that, and want to dig into some of the details that you haven't gotten around to yet. If so, this is for you. 

I hope to explain these things in a way that makes you a better Javascript developer. This is not meant to be a collection of arcana -- it's meant to be useful.
