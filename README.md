# JS-Lessons

I've written some Javascripts in my day. This is my attempt at explaining some parts of how the language work. It will focus on parts of JS which typically do not get in-depth explanations, or which I find to be generally poorly understood.

This is not intended for beginners to Javascript, or beginners to programming. This is intended for people who use Javascript often and would like to understand it better.

Maybe you've used Javascript for years, or less than that, and want to dig into some of the details that you haven't gotten around to yet. Maybe you had some weird thing happen and you didn't have time to fully grok it, so you wrote around it, and maybe it's been bugging you ever since. If so, this is for you.

I hope to explain these things in a way that makes you a better Javascript developer. Part of honing your skills is understanding the tools you use in depth.

#### A note about style

The style of Javascript used in the examples may be a bit unfamiliar to you. Even if you don't care for it, consider that you will read lots of different people's code over time. So it's worth making an effort to understand code even when you don't like how it's written. :)
